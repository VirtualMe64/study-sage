# Scene-Based Outline Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive scene-based, parallel outline refinement workflow for the Manim video generator agent. The implementation enforces a **two-phase approach** with outline-first workflow and parallel scene refinement before any Manim code is produced.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Two-Phase Workflow

- **Phase 1**: Outline & Scene Refinement (multi-round)
- **Phase 2**: Manim code generation (only after outline approval)
- Hard guardrails prevent code generation before outline approval

### 2. Scene-Based Outline Structure

- Machine-parseable scene delimiters: `---SCENE: <number> | <title>---`
- Required fields per scene:
    - Objectives
    - Narration/On-screen text
    - Visual plan
    - Animation plan
    - Dependencies
    - Assessment hook (optional)

### 3. Parallel Scene Refinement

- Concurrent processing with configurable limits (default: 4 scenes)
- Enhanced scene outlines with:
    - Precise object names and IDs
    - Ordered animation steps
    - Timing hints
    - Continuity hooks (export/import)
    - Technical notes (Manim classes/methods)
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Graceful failure handling

### 4. Outline Validation

- Scene numbering continuity checks
- Object name conflict detection
- Dependency resolution validation
- Technical implementation readiness assessment
- Comprehensive error/warning/suggestion reporting

### 5. Enhanced Code Generation

- Updated to work with approved outlines
- Respects object names and structure from outlines
- Follows animation steps and timing hints
- Maintains continuity between scenes

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### Scene Delimiter Format

```
---SCENE: 1 | Intuition for Derivatives---
Objectives: Build intuition for derivative as instantaneous rate of change.
Narration/On-screen: "Slope of tangent line equals instantaneous rate of change."
Visual plan: Cartesian plane, f(x)=x^2, moving point P on curve, tangent line at P.
Animation plan: Draw axes -> plot f(x) -> animate point P moving -> construct secant -> limit to tangent.
Dependencies: None
---ENDSCENE---
```

### Parallel Processing

- Configurable concurrency limits (default: 4)
- Batch processing with delays between batches
- Individual scene failure handling
- Progress logging and error reporting

### Validation System

- **Errors**: Block progression (numbering, conflicts, missing dependencies)
- **Warnings**: Non-blocking issues (missing technical details)
- **Suggestions**: Improvement recommendations

### JSON Output

- Structured JSON alongside text outlines
- Machine-parseable format for orchestration
- Extracted Manim class suggestions
- Dependency mapping

## üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails Implemented

### Code Generation Prevention

- Hard rule: No code until outline approval
- Clear error messages for early code requests
- Workflow-level enforcement

### Validation Enforcement

- Required field validation
- Object naming conflict detection
- Dependency resolution checking
- Technical readiness assessment

### Concurrency Management

- Rate limiting with delays
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation on failures

## üìä Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow

```typescript
// Phase 1: Generate outline
const result = await mastra.workflows.manimOutlineWorkflow.execute({
    topic: "Derivatives and Rate of Change",
    complexity: "intermediate",
    depth: "detailed",
});

// Phase 2: Generate code (after approval)
const codeResult = await mastra.workflows.manimOutlineWorkflow.execute({
    topic: "Derivatives and Rate of Change",
    skipToCodeGeneration: true,
    approvedOutline: result.approvedOutline,
});
```

### JSON Output

```typescript
import { generateOutlineWithJson } from "./src/mastra/utils/outline-json-generator";

const { textOutline, jsonOutline } = generateOutlineWithJson(outline);
```

## üîç Testing

- ‚úÖ All files compile successfully
- ‚úÖ No linting errors
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type checking passes
- ‚úÖ Mastra build successful
- ‚úÖ Test script created for demonstration

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

1. **Structured Approach**: Enforces outline-first workflow
2. **Parallel Processing**: Faster scene refinement with concurrency limits
3. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation before code generation
4. **Flexibility**: JSON output for programmatic processing
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
6. **User Control**: Explicit approval required before code generation
7. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling and clear error messages

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow** with real topics
2. **Integrate approval UI** for outline review
3. **Add more validation rules** as needed
4. **Optimize concurrency limits** based on usage
5. **Add more Manim class suggestions** in refinement
6. **Implement caching** for repeated refinements

## üìù Developer Notes

- Scene delimiters are stable and machine-parseable
- Object naming follows clear conventions
- Dependencies are tracked across scenes
- Technical notes guide Manim implementation
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing workflow

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements from the original request and provides a robust, scalable foundation for scene-based Manim video generation.
